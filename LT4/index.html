<h1>My Personal Quest</h1>
	
<h2>by Patricia Fleming</h2>

<p>For most of my life, I've been on a quest<br />
To discover just who I might be,<br />
Earnestly searching, day after day,<br />
So desperate to recognize me.</p>
	
<p>I've felt moments of utter fulfillment<br />
And moments I couldn't go on,<br />
But I knew for the sake of my heart and my soul,<br />
To succeed, I would have to be strong.</p>
	
<p>I've wanted so much to be happy,<br />
To know what it was to feel peace,<br />
And I thought if I finally felt sure of myself,,<br />
Then the pain and the struggles would cease.</p>
	
<p>But I've learned that this journey is endless;<br />
The discoveries are fresh every day,<br />
And no matter how much I might know of myself,<br />
They'll be times I will still lose my way.</p>
	
<p>But always remember not to stray far<br />
From what matters and what's really true.<br />
In this life you don't have to be perfect.<br />
In the end, you just have to be you.</p>
